### Atom

If you are using [Atom](https://atom.io) with `ember-cli`, there is a package available that allows you to run commands right from Atom.

`Atom -> Preferences -> Install`

Search for [ember-cli-helper](https://atom.io/packages/ember-cli-helper)

`Install`

### SublimeText 3

If you are using [SublimeText 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) with `ember-cli`, by default it will try to index all files in your `tmp` directory for its GoToAnything functionality.  This will cause your computer to come to a screeching halt @ 90%+ CPU usage.  Simply remove these directories from the folders ST3 watches:

`Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings -User`

{% highlight javascript %}
// folder_exclude_patterns and file_exclude_patterns control which files
// are listed in folders on the side bar. These can also be set on a per-
// project basis.
"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
{% endhighlight %}

### WebStorm
If you are using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) with `ember-cli`, you will need to modify your `.gitignore` file, enable `ECMAScript6` settings, and mark certain directories.

First, add the following line to `.gitignore`:
{% highlight %}
.idea
{% endhighlight %}
 
Next, from the WebStorm menu:

`File > Settings -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> ECMAScript6`

Right-click on each of the following directories and mark as indicated:

Mark as `excluded`:
{% highlight %}
/tmp
/dist
{% endhighlight %}

Mark as `resource route`:
{% highlight %}
/
/bower_components
/bower_components/ember-qunit/lib
/public
{% endhighlight %}
 
Mark as `test sources root`:
{% highlight %}
/tests
{% endhighlight %}
